# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start.
### Step 2: 
Get the inputs from the user for the coordinates of the first point (x_1,x_2) and the second point (y_1,y_2).
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Calculate the distance between the points and print the result.
### Step 5:
End.
